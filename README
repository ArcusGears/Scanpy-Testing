README

This project is an attempt to use Scanpy's library to analize cell data that we have after preforming dropseq on cells

Currently the program pulls from our own cell data, but it mostly follows the scanpy tutorial
The Scanpy tutorial for clustering that this follows is located here: 
https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html

I am mostly running this through the terminal as I SSH into a remote workstation that has all the cell data, so it is really meant to be run line by line, or section by section rather than as a full on .py file

Current Problems:
I cannont seem to get the program to produce the plots.  I am unsure if this is because they are displaying on the remote system and are therefore unviewable to me at my workstation, or if I am improperly writing the plotting functions.
