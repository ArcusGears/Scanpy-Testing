README

This project is an attempt to use Scanpy's library to analize cell data that we have after preforming dropseq on cells

Currently the program pulls from our own cell data, but it mostly follows the scanpy tutorial
The Scanpy tutorial for clustering that this follows is located here: 
https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html

I am mostly running this through the terminal as I SSH into a remote workstation that has all the cell data, so it is really meant to be run line by line, or section by section rather than as a full on .py file

Current Problems:
1. Why do the genes appear as numbers (see "highest expression" graph in the figures folder) rather than as their gene names.

2. Trying to add some sort of "metadata" tag to the anndata objects when they are read in from our files, and before they are combined.  This is to allow us to sort the cluster groups by day, rather than just "nearest neighbor" as it does now.
